# ZMO AI Pipelines

A collection of easy-to-use AI tools for processing documents and audio files. These tools use Google's Gemini AI to automatically transcribe, extract text, and generate summaries.

## üéØ What Can These Tools Do?

### üìù Audio Transcription
Convert your audio recordings into text automatically. Perfect for:
- Meeting recordings
- Interviews
- Lectures and presentations
- Q&A sessions

**Supported formats:** MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, OGG, WebM, MP4, AAC

### üìÑ OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
Extract text from scanned documents or PDFs with printed text. Works with:
- Any language and writing system
- Newspapers, books, reports, letters
- Forms and technical documents
- Documents with both printed and handwritten text

### ‚úçÔ∏è HTR (Handwritten Text Recognition)
Transcribe handwritten documents with high precision. Specialized support for:
- French handwritten documents
- Arabic handwritten manuscripts
- Multilingual handwritten documents

### üìä Text Summarization
Generate concise summaries with keywords from long text documents automatically. Choose between OpenAI or Google Gemini models. Summaries are generated in the same language as the input text.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Python

You need Python 3.8 or newer installed on your computer.
- **Windows:** Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Mac/Linux:** Python is usually pre-installed

### Step 2: Get API Keys

**For Gemini (required for Audio, OCR, and HTR):**
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy your API key (you'll need it in the next step)

**For OpenAI (optional, for Text Summarization only):**
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy your API key

### Step 3: Set Up Your Environment

1. **Download or clone this project** to your computer
2. **Open a terminal/command prompt** in the project folder
3. **Install required packages:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Create a `.env` file** by copying the example:
   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Open `.env` in a text editor
   - Replace `your_gemini_api_key_here` with your actual Gemini API key
   - (Optional) Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your OpenAI API key if you want to use OpenAI for summaries

### Step 4: (Optional) Install FFmpeg for Audio Splitting

If you want to split long audio files into smaller segments for better accuracy:

**Windows:**
```
winget install Gyan.FFmpeg
```

**Mac:**
```
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Linux:**
```
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

After installation, update the paths in your `.env` file if needed.

## üìñ How to Use Each Tool

All tools now support **two modes of operation**:
1. **Direct Mode** - Process all files in a folder
2. **Spreadsheet Mode** - Use an Excel file to specify which files to process and collect results

### üé§ Audio Transcription

**Direct Mode:**
1. Place your audio files in the `Audio-transcription/Audio/` folder
2. Open a terminal in the `Audio-transcription/` folder
3. Run:
   ```
   python transcribe_audio.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to:
   - Choose between faster or higher quality processing
   - Select a transcription style (meeting minutes, interview, lecture, etc.)
   - Decide if you want to split long audio files
5. Find your transcriptions in the `Audio-transcription/Transcriptions/` folder

**Tips:**
- Splitting audio into 10-minute segments can improve accuracy for long recordings
- Use the appropriate prompt style for best results (e.g., "meeting minutes" for business meetings)

### üìÑ OCR (Printed Text)

**Direct Mode:**
1. Place your PDF files in the `OCR/PDF/` folder
2. Open a terminal in the `OCR/` folder
3. Run:
   ```
   python gemini_ocr_processor.py

5. The script will process all PDFs automatically
6. Find the extracted text in the `OCR/OCR_Results/` folder
7. Check the `OCR/log/` folder for processing details

**Spreadsheet Mode:**
1. Create an Excel file (`.xlsx` or `.xls`) with a column named `filename`
2. List the PDF filenames you want to process in this column
3. Place the Excel file in the `OCR/PDF/` folder
4. Place your PDF files in the same `OCR/PDF/` folder
5. Run:
   ```
   python gemini_ocr_processor.py
   ```
6. Choose your Gemini model
7. The script will automatically detect the Excel file and:
   - Process only the PDFs listed in the spreadsheet
   - Add an `OCR` column with the extracted text
   - Save the updated spreadsheet with results
8. Check the `OCR/log/` folder for processing details

**Spreadsheet Benefits:**
- Process specific files from a large collection
- Keep all results organized in one file
- Easily feed OCR results to the Summary pipeline
- Track which files have been processed

**Best for:**
- Books, newspapers, magazines
- Printed documents in any language
- Forms and official documents

### ‚úçÔ∏è HTR (Handwritten Text)

**Direct Mode:**

## üîÑ Complete Pipeline Workflow

You can now chain all three tools together using spreadsheets:

**Example: OCR ‚Üí Summary Pipeline**
1. Create `data.xlsx` with a `filename` column listing your PDF files
2. Place `data.xlsx` and PDFs in `OCR/PDF/` folder
3. Run OCR: `python gemini_ocr_processor.py`
   - Result: Excel file now has `filename` and `OCR` columns
4. Move `data.xlsx` to `Summary/TXT/` folder
5. Run Summary: `python AI_generate_summaries.py`
   - Result: Excel file now has `filename`, `OCR`, `Summary`, and `Keywords` columns

**Example: HTR ‚Üí Summary Pipeline**
1. Create `manuscripts.xlsx` with a `filename` column
2. Place it in `HTR/PDF/` with your handwritten PDFs
3. Run HTR: `python gemini_htr_processor.py`
   - Result: Excel file now has `filename` and `HTR` columns
4. Move `manuscripts.xlsx` to `Summary/TXT/` folder
5. Run Summary (it will read from `OCR` or `HTR` column)
   - Result: Excel file now has `filename`, `HTR`, `Summary`, and `Keywords` columns

**Spreadsheet Column Names:**
- **Input for OCR/HTR:** `filename` (required)
- **Output from OCR:** `OCR` (created automatically)
- **Output from HTR:** `HTR` (created automatically)
- **Input for Summary:** `OCR` or `HTR` (must exist)
- **Output from Summary:** `Summary` and `Keywords` (created automatically)

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### For Audio Transcription:
- Use clear audio recordings without too much background noise
- For long recordings (over 30 minutes), enable audio splitting
- Choose the right prompt style for your content type

### For OCR:
- Use high-quality scans (300 DPI or higher recommended)
- Ensure pages are properly oriented (not upside down)
- Clear, well-lit scans work best

### For HTR:
- High-resolution scans are crucial for handwritten documents
- Clean, clear handwriting transcribes better
- Historical documents may require manual review for accuracy

### For Spreadsheet Mode:
- Use `.xlsx` or `.xls` format (Excel files)
- The `filename` column is required for OCR/HTR processing
- Files without the `.pdf` extension will have it added automatically
- Rows with missing filenames or files will be skipped with clear error messages
- The spreadsheet is updated in place - keep a backup if needed
- You can process the same spreadsheet multiple times (e.g., re-run failed items)
- Empty or error rows are clearly marked so you can identify issues

### General:
- Process one or a few files at a time initially to check quality
- Check the log files if something goes wrong
- Keep your API key private and never share it
- Spreadsheet mode is ideal for batch processing and keeping organized records

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "API Key not found" error
- Make sure you created the `.env` file (not `.env.example`)
- Check that your API key is correctly pasted in the `.env` file
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or quotes around the key

### "No audio/PDF files found" error
- Check that you placed files in the correct folder
- Verify the file format is supported
- Make sure the file isn't corrupted

### FFmpeg-related errors (audio splitting)
- Audio transcription works without FFmpeg, you just can't split files
- Install FFmpeg using the instructions in Step 4
- Update the paths in your `.env` file if needed

### Processing is slow
- This is normal! AI processing takes time
- Larger files take longer to process
- Consider using the faster model (gemini-2.5-flash) for quick tasks
